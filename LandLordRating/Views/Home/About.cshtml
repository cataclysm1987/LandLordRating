<p>Landlord Watch is for tenants to rate their previous landlord. This system is for landlord accountability.  By reviewing the landlords it helps them be aware of tenant needs and concerns. This rating system allows landlords to be recognized as good property owners who are working to make their property/properties desirable living spaces.</p>

<p>Our mission is simple: get more openness and accountability from landlords and better communication between landlords and tenants.</p>

<p>If you are a landlord, you can claim or create a landlord page by signing up and claiming a page.</p>
